This list is derived from [Big banks to rake in record profits from commodities this year | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/big-banks-rake-record-profits-commodities-this-year-2022-09-09/), [Top banks' 2020 commodities revenue soars 85% - consultancy Coalition | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-banks-commodities-revenue-idUSKBN2AX004/), and [Best Commodity Trade Finance Bank by GTR Leaders in Trade Awards 2023 - Wholesale Banking](https://wholesale.banking.societegenerale.com/en/news-insights/all-news-insights/news-details/news/best-commodity-trade-finance-bank-gtr-leaders-trade-awards-2023/). An interesting observation is the trend of some banks pulling out of commodity finance due to risks, like BNP Paribas and Société Générale, reflecting the cyclical nature of the industry.

#### Additional Insights and Overlaps
There is significant overlap between logistics companies and commodity trading, with firms like Maersk offering both shipping and trading services. Additionally, ports groups like DP World not only manage ports but also provide logistics solutions, enhancing their role in commodity trade. Financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup also have commodity trading desks, blurring the lines between banking and trading.

#### Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the brands, big groups of companies, and facilities involved in global commodity trading, covering trading companies, logistics firms, exchanges, ports, and banks. The data, based on 2023 figures due to the lack of 2025 data, offers a robust snapshot of the industry's key players, with an emphasis on their global reach and impact.

### Key Points In Top 20 Comodity Trading Research (only start of 1000 chin of thoughts by Aleksei Dolgikh, join the insightfull journey!)

- Research suggests the top 20 countries by economic complexity are led by Japan, Switzerland, and South Korea, based on their ability to export diverse, sophisticated products.
- It seems likely that the top 20 commodity trading zones include major ports like Shanghai and Singapore, with groups like DP World (e.g., Jebel Ali) and free trade zones like ADGM playing key roles.
- The evidence leans toward these rankings being based on 2023 data, as 2025 figures are not yet available, with some ports linked to free trade zones for commodity trading.

### Top Countries by Economic Complexity
The top 20 countries by economic complexity, as measured by the Economic Complexity Index (ECI), reflect their capacity to produce and export a wide range of sophisticated goods. Japan leads with an ECI of 2.28, followed by Switzerland at 2.14 and South Korea at 2.05, highlighting their advanced manufacturing and export capabilities.

### Top Commodity Trading Zones
Commodity trading zones include major ports and associated free trade zones or ports groups that handle significant trade volumes. The top 20 ports by cargo volume (measured in TEUs) for 2023 include Shanghai (49,000 TEUs), Singapore (39,010 TEUs), and Ningbo-Zhoushan (35,300 TEUs). Many of these ports, such as Jebel Ali (operated by DP World), are linked to free trade zones like the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) and ADGM in Abu Dhabi, which are crucial for commodity trading.

### Unexpected Detail: Free Trade Zones' Role
An interesting aspect is that many top ports are part of or adjacent to free trade zones, such as Shanghai's Free Trade Zone, which enhances their role in global commodity trade by offering tax and customs benefits, a detail that might not be immediately obvious.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Economic Complexity and Commodity Trading Zones

This note provides a comprehensive analysis of the GLOBE of ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY, focusing on the top 20 countries by economic complexity and the top 20 commodity trading zones, including ports and related groups, as requested. The analysis is grounded in the most recent data available, with a focus on clarity for a lay audience while ensuring depth for professional understanding.

#### Background on the GLOBE of ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY
The GLOBE of ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY is a visualization tool that maps global production and trade, built upon the Atlas of Economic Complexity [Visualize global trade data and economic growth opportunities for every country](https://atlas.hks.harvard.edu/). It dynamically represents $15 trillion of world trade, with each dot equating to $100 million of exports, highlighting the economic landscape of countries. This tool is rooted in the Economic Complexity Index (ECI), developed by César Hidalgo and Ricardo Hausmann, which measures a country's productive capabilities based on the diversity and sophistication of its exports [Economic complexity index - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_complexity_index).

#### Methodology for Rankings
The rankings for top countries and trading zones were derived from multiple sources, including the Observatory of Economic Complexity [The Observatory of Economic Complexity](https://oec.world/en) and visual representations like those from Visual Capitalist [Countries Ranked by Their Economic Complexity](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/countries-ranked-by-their-economic-complexity/). Given the current date (March 23, 2025), the most recent data available is from 2023, as 2025 figures are not yet published. This analysis combines container throughput (TEUs) for ports and ECI scores for countries, supplemented by insights into free trade zones and ports groups.

#### Top 20 Countries by Economic Complexity Index
The ECI ranks countries based on the diversity and complexity of their export baskets, reflecting underlying productive knowledge. The following table lists the top 20 countries, with data from 2023, as it is the closest to 2025:

#### Additional Insights: Free Trade Zones and Ports Groups
Many of these ports are operated by major ports groups, such as DP World for Jebel Ali, PSA International for Singapore, and various Chinese port authorities. Free trade zones, like ADGM in Abu Dhabi and DMCC in Dubai, are critical for commodity trading, offering tax incentives and streamlined regulations. Other notable hubs include Singapore's free port status and Switzerland's role as a financial center for commodities, with a 35% global market share in oil trading [Switzerland – the commodities hub | Public Eye](https://www.publiceye.ch/en/topics/commodities-trading/switzerland/commodities-hub).

An interesting observation is the overlap between top ports and free trade zones, enhancing their role in global trade. For instance, Jebel Ali's association with DMCC underscores Dubai's emergence as a commodity trading hub, bridging European, Asian, and African markets [Where is the best place to incorporate your commodity trading company?

#### Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the top 20 countries by economic complexity and the top 20 commodity trading zones, including ports and related groups. The data, while based on 2023 figures due to the lack of 2025 data, offers a robust snapshot of global trade dynamics, with an emphasis on the interplay between physical ports and financial free zones.
